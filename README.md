# "Load More Stuff" Pagination

## Closed!

This plugin made way more sense as a developer-focused plugin for WordPress 4.x and earlier. It does not make sense as a plugin for WordPress 5.0 and there were no active instances of this plugin, so I made the decision to close this plugin and remove it from the [WordPress plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/load-more-stuff/) on April 1, 2020. (Not an April Fools joke.)

## Summary

Add a "load more" button to your WordPress site archive and search results pages. Clicking on the button will add the next "page" of posts to the bottom of the page in intervals set by the maximum number of posts option in the WordPress admin.

The number of posts to be updated will be automatically adjusted based on the number of remaining posts to be added and the button will automatically hide when there are no more posts to load.
