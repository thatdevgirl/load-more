# "Load More Stuff" Pagination

Add a "load more" button to your WordPress site archive and search results pages to dynamically load additional posts without pagination or page loads (i.e. via AJAX).  Clicking on the button will add additional posts from a query to the bottom of the page in intervals set by the maximum number of posts option in the WordPress admin.

The number of posts to be updated will be automatically adjusted based on the number of remaining posts to be added and the button will automatically hide when there are no more posts to load.
